# Angular Change Detection
This repo is used to show the differences in how the Default and OnPush change detection strategies work in Angular

## How to run
`npm install`

`npm start`

Browse to http://localhost:4200 to view the app with Default change detection

Browse to http://localhost:4200/onpush to view the app with OnPush change detection
